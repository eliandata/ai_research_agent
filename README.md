# AI Research Agent
FastAPI service powered by the OpenAI Agents SDK that answers research questions and performs basic calculations.

It uses a triage system to route queries either to a Web Search Agent or a Math Agent, with guardrails to block offensive input.

# â–¶ 5. Run the API with Uvicorn
From the project root:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

# ðŸ§ª 6. Quick test
**Using Swagger UI**
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Expand POST /ask

Click Try it out and enter:
```
{
  "question": "What were the main causes and consequences of the Chernobyl disaster?"
}

```

# ðŸ›¡ Guardrails
This agent includes an input guardrail that blocks offensive or inappropriate questions.

If triggered, the API will return a 400 Bad Request with an explanation.

# ðŸ“Œ Example questions for testing
